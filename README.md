# Machine Learning Small Project
Some small projects of the machine learning course

In the branch Final Project, I used 3 dataset from UCI database. 

1. HIV-1 protease cleavage
2. Diabetes 130-US hospitals
3. KEGG Metabolic Relation Network

Also, I made some pre-process to fit my experiment. You can also dowload the original dataa from the link below:
